        <h2>About {{ site.title }}</h2>

        <p>There are many topics that local communities regard as particularly
        pressing, but journalists usually only discover them by accident. This
        problem inspired our idea to create a platform where citizensâ€™ concerns
        can be collected and rated on a municipal level. That way a newspaper
        can create space for those topics, host a discussion and bring
        additional value to the local community.</p>

        <p>IRIS is the platform behind
        <a href="https://petitio.ch">petitio.ch</a>. It was co-founded by the
        <a href="https://www.digitalnewsinitiative.com/">The Digital News
        Initiative (DNI)</a>.</p>
