        <p>There are many topics that local communities regard as particularly
        pressing, but journalists usually only discover them by accident. This
        problem inspired our idea to create a platform where citizensâ€™ concerns
        can be collected and rated on a municipal level. That way a newspaper
        can create space for those topics, host a discussion and bring
        additional value to the local community.</p>
